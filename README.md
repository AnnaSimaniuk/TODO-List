# ToDo List App - JavaScript

The ToDo List app is a powerful and easy-to-use task management tool. It provides users with the ability to create tasks, set due dates, and categorize tasks based on their priority. The app supports drag-and-drop functionality, making it convenient to rearrange tasks within the list. The use of local storage ensures that tasks are persistently saved, allowing users to access their tasks across sessions.

For convenience, the project is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://annasimaniuk.github.io/TODO-List/).
